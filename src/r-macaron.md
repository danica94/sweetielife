    <h1> Marcaron</h1>
    <p>This is the quintessential macaron (NOT macaroon) recipe. I am a baker's apprentice, and after much trial and error, we (the baker and I) finally perfected the technique. We decided to share with you all. Pipe your choice of filling on a cookie and sandwich another cookie on top. These are like cloud cookie sandwiches and are delicious if done correctly. If you want to do it the super-easy way, just fill with your favorite flavor of frosting. Enjoy!</p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <div class="steplayout">
      <h3 class="w30">Step 1</h3>
      <p class="w70">Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
       <h3 class="w30" >Step 2</h3>
       <p class="w50">Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until whites are foamy; beat in white sugar and continue beating until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks. Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl and quickly fold the almond mixture into the egg whites, about 30 strokes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
       <h3 class="w30">Step 3</h3>
       <p class="w50">Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold the batter a few more times and retest.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
         <h3 class="w30">Step 4</h3>
         <p class="w50">When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let the piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
          <h3 class="w30">Step 5</h3>
          <p class="w70">Preheat oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
       <h3 class="w30">Step 6</h3>
       <p class="w70">Bake cookies until set but not browned, about 10 minutes; let cookies cool completely before filling.</p>
