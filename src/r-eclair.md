    <h1> Eclair</h1>
    <p> Eclair is a pastry made with choux dough filled with a cream and topped with a flavored icing. The dough, which is the same as that used for profiterole, is typically piped into an oblong shape with a pastry bag and baked until it is crisp and hollow inside. Once cool, the pastry is filled with custard (crème pâtissière), whipped cream or chiboust cream, then iced with fondant icing.[3] Other fillings include pistachio- and rum-flavoured custard, fruit-flavoured fillings, or chestnut purée. The icing is sometimes caramel, in which case the dessert may be called a bâton de Jacob.[4] A similar pastry in a round rather than oblong shape is called a Religieuse.</p>

      <h1>Directions</h1>
      <div class="steplayout">
      <h3 class="w30">Step 1</h3>
      <p class="w70">Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
       <h3 class="w30" >Step 2</h3>
       <p class="w50">Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until whites are foamy; beat in white sugar and continue beating until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks. Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl and quickly fold the almond mixture into the egg whites, about 30 strokes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
       <h3 class="w30">Step 3</h3>
       <p class="w50">Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold the batter a few more times and retest.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
         <h3 class="w30">Step 4</h3>
         <p class="w50">When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let the piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.</p>

          <h3 class="w30">Step 5</h3>
          <p class="w70">Preheat oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
       <h3 class="w30">Step 6</h3>
       <p class="w70">Bake cookies until set but not browned, about 10 minutes; let cookies cool completely before filling.</p>
