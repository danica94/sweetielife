    <h1> Croissants</h1>
    <p>Croissants is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[2] Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <div class="steplayout">
      <h3 class="w30">Step 1</h3>
      <p class="w50">In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in milk, salt, sugar, 1 egg, 1 cup flour and melted butter. Beat to make a smooth batter; set aside.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
       <h3 class="w30" >Step 2</h3>
       <p class="w50">In a large bowl, cut the one cup firm butter into remaining four cups flour until butter particles are the size of dried kidney beans. Pour the yeast batter over this and carefully turn the mixture over with a spatula to blend, just until all flour is moistened. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or up to four days.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
       <h3 class="w30">Step 3</h3>
       <p class="w50">Turn dough out onto a floured surface; press into compact balls and knead about 6 turns to release air bubbles. Divide dough into four equal parts. Shape one at a time. Refrigerate the remaining dough.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
         <h3 class="w30">Step 4</h3>
         <p class="w50">Roll one part of the dough on a floured board into a circle 17 inches in diameter. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the circle into eight equal pie-shaped wedges. Roll the wedges loosely toward the point. Shape each roll into a crescent and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Allow 1 1/2 inches space between each roll.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="steplayout">
          <h3 class="w30">Step 5</h3>
          <p class="w70">Cover and let rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size. Approximately 2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</p>
      </div>
